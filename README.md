# Go_practice

after programming in many languages like C,C++,C#,java, python and etc ,
I find Golang the best language in software backend developing because of four reasons :

+ Support multithreading programming strongly and easily .
+ Having shortcuts of python . 
+ Start a new project with no unnecessary files ( Its not like laravel !! )
+ Give programmer the most freedom !! 
------
I started with tour of Go and this repo is the play ground for that tour . you can follow that tour in the link  below :

-------
after this tour I learned fundamentals of programming with golang so that I could run a url shortener backend server .

+ you can see my url shortener in following repo :
