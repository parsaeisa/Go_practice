## Structure

Golang offers a **flat** project structure. It doesn't offer very hierarchical packaging like Java. 

## Parent type 
consider an interface called `validator.ValidationErrors` implements the error interface ( the error in golang is an interface and by validator I mean [this]("github.com/go-playground/validator/v10")) . Lot of methods return error in their output, but sometimes we need other methods that are defined in `validator.ValidationErrors` but not implemented in `error`.

In such cases by the code below, we can access those methods:
```go
err.(validator.ValidationErrors)
```
