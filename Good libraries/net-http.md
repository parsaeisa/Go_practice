# net/http package

First usage that I found about net/http package is that you can discover clients connection based on it. 

Tjhis example tries to find the appropriate size of the served image based on client network status:
```go
func main(){
    // Determine the client's network conditions
    networkType := getNetworkType(r)

    // Set the desired image dimensions based on network conditions
    var width, height int
    switch networkType {
    case "wifi":
        width, height = 800, 600 // Adjust for high resolution on WiFi
    case "mobile":
        width, height = 300, 200 // Adjust for lower resolution on mobile networks
    default:
        width, height = 500, 400 // Default dimensions
    }
}

func getNetworkType(r *http.Request) string {
	// Extract network type from the request, for example, based on user-agent or other headers
	userAgent := r.Header.Get("User-Agent")
	if strings.Contains(userAgent, "Mobile") {
		return "mobile"
	}
	// You might need more sophisticated logic to determine network type
	return "wifi"
}
```
